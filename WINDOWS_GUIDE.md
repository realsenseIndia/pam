# Desktop (Windows) Usage Guide

You can install the **Personal Accounts Manager** on your Windows computer to make it run like a standalone application (no browser address bar, desktop icon, independent window).

## Option 1: Install as App (Recommended)

1.  Open `index.html` in **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.
2.  Look at the right side of the address bar (URL bar).
3.  You should see an **"Install Personal Accounts Manager"** icon (usually a small monitor with a down arrow).
4.  Click it and select **Install**.
5.  The app will launch in its own window.
    *   A desktop shortcut will be created.
    *   You can pin it to your Taskbar.

## Option 2: Run via Browser

1.  Simply double-click `index.html`.
2.  Use it as a normal website.

## Syncing with Mobile

To move data between your Windows App and Mobile App:
1.  **Export**: Go to Settings -> Download Data.
2.  **Transfer**: Send the file to your phone (or vice versa).
3.  **Import**: Go to Settings -> Upload Data and select the file.
